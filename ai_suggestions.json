    "suggestions": "The code contains the following critical issues:\n\n1. **Division by Zero Error**: The function `divide_by_zero()` attempts to divide by zero, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when called.\n\n2. **Syntax Error**: The `if` statement in `main()` is missing a colon (`:`) at the end, which will cause a syntax error and prevent the code from running.\n\nThese issues need to be addressed for the code to function correctly."
